 **TITLE** : Kerry to Visit Paris After U.S. Absence at Unity March
 
**TEXT**:U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry announced he will visit Paris later this week amid criticism that no top American officials attended the recent unity march against terrorism. Kerry, who had prior commitments in India, will meet French leaders on Friday following meetings in Bulgaria. His visit aims to address concerns over the U.S. absence at the march, which saw around 40 world leaders, including Israelâ€™s Prime Minister Netanyahu, participating. Kerry downplayed the criticism, noting U.S. support for France, and emphasized the strong ties between the two nations.
